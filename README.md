# ✊🖐✌ Rock - Paper - Scissors Game using Python

This is an educational Python project that allows users to play the classic "Rock - Paper - Scissors" game against the computer.  
The project aims to enhance basic programming skills through simple logic and interactive command-line input.

---

## 🎯 Educational Objectives

- Practice writing interactive Python code.
- Understand the use of conditions (if/else) and decision-making logic.
- Learn how to interact with the user via the terminal.
- Use the **random** library to generate random choices.
- Apply a basic ideagenerative AIAI** with a ChatGPT-enhanced version.

## 🧠 How the Game Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter one of the following:
   - rock
   - paper
   - scissors

2. The computer randomly selects one of the same options.

3. The program compares the user's choice with the computer's and determines the result:

   | User       | Computer   | Result             |
   |------------|------------|--------------------|
   | Rock       | Scissors   | ✅ User wins        |
   | Paper      | Rock       | ✅ User wins        |
   | Scissors   | Paper      | ✅ User wins        |
   | Same Choice| Same Choice| 🤝 It's a tie       |
   | Other cases| -          | ❌ Computer wins    |

4. The result is displayed to the user.
